Streams:- Streams are object that let you read data from a source or write data to a destination in continuus fashion.
In node js there are four types of streams--

Readable:- stream which is used for read operation

Writable:- stream which is used for write operation

Duplex:-   stream which can be used for both read and write operation

Transform:-A type of Duplex stream where the output is computed on input

================================================================================
Each type of Streams is an EventEmmiter instance and throws several events at different instance of times. For example, some if the commonly used evants are ---

1.  data:- the evants is fired when there is data is available to read.

2.  end:- the events is fired when there is no more data to read

3.  error:- this events is fired when there is any error recieving or writing data.

4.  finish:- the evants is fired when all the data has been flushed to underlying system.
